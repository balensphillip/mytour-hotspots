                   Egypt thousands of years ago. They were tombs for pharaohs, or kings, 
                   and their consorts, and were meant to help the pharaohs achieve eternal 
                   life in the afterworld.The most famous pyramids are the three Great 
                   Pyramids of Giza, which were built during the Old Kingdom period between

                   Sossusvlei is a famous destination in Namibia known for its massive red sand dunes 
                   that tower over the surrounding desert landscape. The dunes were formed over millions 
                   of years by the constant movement of sand and wind, and they are some of the highest 
                   in the world. Despite the harsh desert conditions, life still manages to thrive in 
                   Sossusvlei.
